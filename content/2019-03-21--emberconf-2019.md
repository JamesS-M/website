First Tech Conference!

This was my first time giving a talk, first time in Portland, Oregon, and I got to meet so many great people!

During the conference I noticed a lot of neat ways to demonstrate and focus on code on slides. I didn't do well at this during my talk, but wanted to provide a place where I track updates to the slides in case anyone wants to reference them. I know that I'll be referencing them as I try to flesh out some ideas in more details. 30 minutes is not a lot of time with such a broad topic!

[Link to slides from the Presentation](todo): [Comparing Patterns in React and Ember](todo)

 - 2019-03-19: Talk / Presented 
 - 2019-03-21: Add code focus/highlight boxes and split up presenter notes to match focus/highlight boxes




\* I've technically given talks at local meetups before.
one was on a ruby gem for bringing the ideas behind ember's module unification efforts to rails, [Drawers](https://github.com/nullvoxpopuli/drawers), and the other was on a topic similar to what I spoke about at emberconf, but much higher level.

\*\* My first _conference_ was gencon 2018. That event takes over the entire downtown Indianapolis area.
